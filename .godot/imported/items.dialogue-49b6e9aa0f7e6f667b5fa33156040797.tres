Ah yes, beloved Brown Puffle plush! 

The plush adorably sits and stares at you, no thoughts in its head. 

Me: I remember June used to be super obsessed with Club Penguin as a kid, even going as far as wanting to become a game developer to pursue developing games professionally! 

Me: Brown Puffle was definitely their favorite though. [wait = 0.2] Similar to the chocolate-colored puffball, June is super smart, inventive, and has a sweet tooth! 

Me: Haha, how adorable… [wait = 0.2]I know June is just really stressed out and burnt out right now,[wait = 0.2] but maybe some good old flash games will cheer them up..?
